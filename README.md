# Servicism
>The commons is older than capitalism, older than corporations, older than nations.  
>It is the birthright of every community.  
>We are restoring, not reinventing, we serve the commons for future society.  

## Why Servicism Matters
The commons are the convergences of rivers where we settle our cities, the knowlege of how to write a book, spread a political philosophy, or make chocolate chip cookies. It is the parks we place in our cities, or the roads we travel to work on. It is the shared project of humanity that our lives contribute to.  No matter what the rich and powerfel men of society say, their success is built on the backs of tens of thousands of years of commons created by humankind, and the commons that no man had a hand in creating that predated us all. We each owe to the commons, and we each draw from the commons. In days past we didn't have the technology to correlate the responsibility to the commons with our withhdrawls, but as we have reached a point where tracking is not only possible, but inescapable, it is time to secure the blessings of the commons a service we provide to ourselves, and our our posterity

With this pholosophy we hope to address:   
An imbalance of power between Capital, Service Providers, and the Commons
